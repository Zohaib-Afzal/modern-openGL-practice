## Where learn openGL
My two favorite webs to learn openGL are *[`Learn openGL`](https://learnopengl.com/)* and *[`opengl-tutorial`](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/)*.

## Types of examples
I have classified the examples in different directories according to the following classification:

<ul>
    <li> **grid**: consists of a mesh of points forming a grid that can be static or dynamic. </li>
</ul>
